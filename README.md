# Third Party Viewer
This is a third-party lesson viewer loader for Connections Academy, which allows some reverse compatibility directly.\
\
It is recommended, albeit not enabled by default for compatibility reasons, to enable legacy login to 2024 or earlier.\
This bypasses the unneeded two-part login that interfers with some browser's password manager, and allows you to save your username for quick login.\
\
It is also recommended to use the new embedded planner instead of events, as it is more functional.\
\
Here are some possible configurations:\
TP On + 2024 Login + Planner-Based Events: Preferred Setup\
TP On + 2021 Login + Legacy Events: Preferred Legacy Setup\
TP Off + 2024 Login + Planner-Based Events: Preferred Loaderless Setup\
TP Off + Default Login + Legacy Events: Off\
TP Off + Default Login + Planner-Based Events: Planner-Based Connexus\
and many more
